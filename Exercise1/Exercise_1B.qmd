## Week 1 Exercise Part B


### 1.Set a seed
Set a seed Set a seed to make output reproducible.

```{r}
set.seed(0)
```

### 2.Sampling

Sample 100 values from a negative binomial distribution where the mu=10 and the dispersion=2.
size=1/dispersion=0.5
```{r}
sample<-rnbinom(100, size=0.5, mu=10)
sample
```

### 3.Plotting
Plot the Histogram of the sampled data on standard scale.

```{r}
hist(sample)
```

Plot the histogram of the sampled data on log scale.

```{r}
hist(log10(sample)+1)

```
### 4.Mean and Variance of sample
```{r}
mean<- mean(sample)
variance<- var(sample)
```

The mean of this sample is `r mean` and the variance is `r variance`.
